        <p class="content-left">Welcome to my personal website! (Please note, it is still under construction, so not all the pieces are in place yet)
          <br>
          I'm Audrey Evergreene, a retired personal trainer and massage therapist turned web developer. While working with clients to help them achieve their health and wellness goals, I discovered a love for puzzles and complex challenges. As I created marketing content and a website for my clinic, I found my fascination of solving difficult problems extended to web development, as well. Embracing the blend of creation and logic, web development has been the perfect outlet for my skills and passion.

        <p class="content-right">What I love about web development is the process of taking a project or business's needs and turning them into a tangible product. The challenge of brainstorming creative solutions and contemplating the different ways a product can meet the needs of its intended audience.
          Once I have a clear understanding of the project requirements, I relish the opportunity to put my front-end development skills to work and bring the project to life. The satisfaction comes from seeing an idea go from concept to reality; web development allows me to explore my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
