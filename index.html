          <p class="content-left">Welcome to my personal website! I'm Audrey Evergreene, a passionate and results-driven software engineer with a focus on front-end development. With a deep-rooted curiosity and a hunger for continuous learning, I thrive in fast-paced and innovative environments.

            Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in building engaging and intuitive user experiences. Proficient in modern JavaScript frameworks, such as React, and experienced in developing data-intensive applications, I have a solid foundation in delivering high-quality front-end solutions.
            
            But it's not just about technical expertise for me. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and community. I actively contribute to open-source projects and immerse myself in developer communities, valuing the exchange of ideas and the collective growth that comes from diverse perspectives..</p>

The opportunity to work with an organization at the forefront of data infrastructure, enabling real-time insights and driving innovation, is truly exciting to me.
