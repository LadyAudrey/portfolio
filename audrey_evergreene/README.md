Welcome!

Desired Effect: I want the children text to fade opacity to 0 on a scroll when the element gets to the top 1/5 (guess?) of the screen, or close to the corner graphics on the top and bottom.

Thank you again for your thoughts!

Note: I am currently putting the scroll effect in a component called ScrollFade.tsx and then passing {children} inside of it. it is creating a fade on the / page (my bio, basically), but it's not happening on scroll, but rather the entire div

I'm not sure what's going on with my other pages not rendering (or rendering the layout twice??) but that's an independent issue I can figure out another day.

This project is built using React, Next and Tailwind

Goal: Portfolio site to showcase Front End web dev skills, portfolio of projects and use of data structures/ algorithms

TDL-

- Portfolio CSS styling and spacing
- Sorting algos for SkillSpotlight
  -Media Queries for responsive
  -Fix X and LinkedIn button
  -Make data have a opacity gradient that faces out on the top/ bottom % of the page

To run this project locally:

clone the repo git clone "repo link"
navigate to repo _cd (directory name)_
install dependencies _npm install_
lastly, run Next _npm run dev_

This should give you a localhost link to open in your browser. If it doesn't, check that you're in the correct directory
