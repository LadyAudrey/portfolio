Welcome!

# Audrey Evergreenes' Portfolio Site

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

I looked at 100+ portfolio websites and chose the format I liked the best. I wanted to explore modern UI with this site.

## ðŸ¤” Purpose

Professional site to showcase front end skills and projects

## ðŸŽ¨ Design

Designd using Figma before it was coded. Below are the wireframes and designs. However. some things were changed so the app does not look exactly like the designs shown.

## ðŸ›  How we Built it

- React
- Next
- Vite
- Tailwind
- Vercel
- Github

## âœ¨ Proud Achievements

How the UI feels for the user. Creating the SVGs' in figma, designing and developing the site. Getting the different elements to overlap and stay where they were supposed to.

## ðŸ˜¤ Challenges Encountered

Some of the changes that the I faced were:

- The scroll fade effect. Still a WIP.

## ðŸ™Œ Insights

I'm excited to see what's possible with Z-indexing and ternary operatorse

## ðŸš€ What's next

Refining the Fade Scroll effect. I'll try GSAP and IntsersectionObserver() next

Tweaking the spacing. It feels a little crowded to me atm, especially in the projects page

Sorting for projects to allow the user to look at the projects with a specific tool or attribute

Media Queries for responsive design
