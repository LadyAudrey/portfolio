      <h2>Front End Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lifelong learner and
        dedicated problem solver, I am transitioning from the healthcare
        industry, where I managed my own 3-therapist clinic. Steering my path
        towards becoming a front-end web development, my passion for untangling
        complex puzzles and creating clean solutions entice me to dive into
        software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to my love
        for problem solving, I am equally fueled by my passion for creating art
        in the digital realm. My goal is to seamlessly merge the precision of
        technology with the creativity of artistry to craft user-centric and
        visually captivating digital experiences. The challenges of front-end
        development excite me as they provide a platform to continuously learn,
        innovate, and redefine the boundaries of what&apos;s achievable.
